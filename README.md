# Practice E-commerce backend built using NodeJS and Express

Welcome to a personal project of mine, attempting to build a back-end for an e-commerce website. Although not unique, this project is my first exposure to NodeJS/Express, allowing me to grasp the basic concepts of Middleware, Routing, web tokens, and other essential features.

## Features

Intended to be robust, alot of these features served as lessons.

- Storage of user details in a Mongoose DB, with various functions to retrieve this data depending on the users role.
- Secure authentication using JSON web-tokens, with access and refresh token implementation.
